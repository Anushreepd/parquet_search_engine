# Parquet Search Engine
 A Simple Full-Stack App for File Upload and Search
                 This is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the upload, storage, and search of records within Parquet files. It provides a user-friendly interface to allow users to seamlessly interact with data without needing complex setups or external dependencies.

## Key Features:
**File Upload:** Users can easily upload Parquet files through the web interface.
**Search Functionality:** After uploading, users can search through the data using keywords or specific criteria to retrieve relevant records instantly.
**Backend in Go:** The backend is powered by Go (Golang), which efficiently handles file uploads, parsing of Parquet files, and serves API requests for searching data.
**Frontend in React:** The frontend is built using React, providing a clean and intuitive UI for users to interact with the application. It allows for seamless uploading of files and execution of search queries.
**Data Handling:** The Parquet files are loaded into memory and parsed into appropriate Go structs, making searching fast and efficient.
**In-Memory Search:** The application does not require a database or external search engine, as it leverages in-memory structures to perform quick searches on uploaded Parquet files.

## Benefits:
**Lightweight:** No heavy database systems are required. The entire search mechanism works within the applicationâ€™s memory, making it lightweight and fast.
**Easy Integration:** The application is simple to set up and can be easily customized to work with other types of data files, making it a versatile tool for various use cases.
**Scalable:** While initially designed for Parquet files, the backend could be extended to support other file formats, and the search capabilities could be enhanced based on project needs.
